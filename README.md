**Project Completion Report: Add, Search User**

 **Introduction**
This document outlines the completion of the "Add, Search User" project, detailing the functionalities implemented in both backend and frontend development. The project aims to provide a secure and efficient user management system with authentication and validation.

 **Project Implementation**

The backend of the project was developed with a focus on security and data integrity. The Add User API was designed to register new users with fields such as Username, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Password. Authentication was implemented using AES encryption, ensuring secure data transmission and storage. Secure encryption techniques were also applied for Basic Authentication, encoding both username and password. Validation measures were implemented to ensure unique usernames and proper field entries. User data was securely stored in a MySQL database, with API responses returned in JSON format providing status and user ID. 

For searching users, the Search User API was developed to retrieve user details using attributes such as User ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, or Username. Authentication measures, including AES encryption, were enforced to ensure that only authorized requests were processed. Security mechanisms were implemented to verify authentication before processing requests. The API returned a JSON array of matching users or an appropriate response when no match was found.

The frontend was designed to offer a seamless and intuitive user experience. The Add User Page featured a user-friendly interface where users could input details such as Username, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Password. Client-side validation was implemented using ReactJS to ensure correct input formatting, with inline validation messages displayed for better usability. Upon submission, the API response was displayed to inform users of successful or failed registrations. 

The User Listing Page was developed to dynamically display stored user information in a tabular format. A search bar was integrated to allow users to filter displayed information in real time, utilizing client-side filtering for enhanced user experience and quick searches. 

 **Conclusion**
The project successfully delivers a secure and intuitive system for managing user information. The backend ensures data integrity and authentication using AES encryption, while the frontend provides an interactive and responsive interface. Future enhancements may include role-based access control, UI improvements, and additional search capabilities.
